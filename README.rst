Running
=======
To see available options::

  ./nvchecker --help

Run with one or more software version source files::

  ./nvchecker source_file

You normally will like to specify some "version record files"; see below.

Version Record Files
====================
Version record files record which version of the software you know or is available. They are simple key-value pairs of ``(name, version)`` seperated by a space\ [v0.3]_::

  fcitx 4.2.7
  google-chrome 27.0.1453.93-200836
  vim 7.3.1024

Say you've got a version record file called ``old_ver.txt`` which records all your watched software and their versions, as well as some configuration entries. To update it using ``nvchecker``::

  ./nvchecker source.ini

See what are updated with ``nvcmp``::

  ./nvcmp source.ini

Manually compare the two files for updates (assuming they are sorted alphabetically; files generated by ``nvchecker`` are already sorted)::

  comm -13 old_ver.txt new_ver.txt
  # or say that in English:
  comm -13 old_ver.txt new_ver.txt | awk '{print $1 " has updated to version " $2 "."}'
  # show both old and new versions
  join old_ver.txt new_ver.txt | awk '$2 != $3'

The ``nvtake`` Command
----------------------
This command helps to manage version record files. It reads both old and new version record files, and a list of names given on the commandline. It then update the versions of those names in the old version record file.

This helps when you have known (and processed) some of the updated software, but not all. You can tell nvchecker that via this command instead of editing the file by hand.

This command will help most if you specify where you version record files are in your config file. See below for how to use a config file.

Version Source Files
====================
The software version source files are in ini format. *Section names* is the name of the software. Following fields are used to tell nvchecker how to determine the current version of that software.

See ``sample_source.ini`` for an example.

Configuration Section
---------------------
A special section named ``__config__`` is special, it provides some configuration options\ [v0.4]_.

Relative path are relative to the source files, and ``~`` and environmental variables are expanded.

Currently supported options are:

oldver
  Specify a version record file containing the old version info.

newver
  Specify a version record file to store the new version info.

Search in a Webpage
-------------------
Search through a specific webpage for the version string. This type of version finding has these fields:

url
  The URL of the webpage to fetch.

encoding
  (*Optional*) The character encoding of the webpage, if ``latin1`` is not appropriate.

regex
  A regular expression used to find the version string.

  It can have zero or one capture group. The capture group or the whole match is the version string.

  When multiple version strings are found, the maximum of those is chosen.

proxy
  The HTTP proxy to use. The format is ``host:port``, e.g. ``localhost:8087``. This requires `pycurl <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_.

user_agent
  The ``User-Agent`` header value to use. Use something more like a tool (e.g. ``curl/7.40.0``) in Europe or the real web page won't get through because cookie policies (SourceForge has this issue).

sort_version_key
  Sort the version string using this key function. Choose between ``parse_version`` and 
  ``vercmp``. Default value is ``parse_version``. ``parse_version`` use 
  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. ``vercmp`` use ``pyalpm.vercmp``.

Find with a Command
-------------------
Use a shell command line to get the version. The output is striped first, so trailing newlines do not bother.

cmd
  The command line to use. This will run with the system's standard shell (i.e. ``/bin/sh``).

Check AUR
---------
Check `Arch User Repository <https://aur.archlinux.org/>`_ for updates.

aur
  The package name in AUR. If empty, use the name of software (the *section name*).

strip-release
  Strip the release part.

Check GitHub
------------
Check `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ for updates. The version returned is in date format ``%Y%m%d``, e.g. ``20130701``.

github
  The github repository, with author, e.g. ``lilydjwg/nvchecker``.

branch
  Which branch to track? Default: ``master``.

use_latest_release
  Set this to ``true`` to check for the latest release on GitHub. An annotated
  tag creates a "release" on GitHub. It's not the same with git tags, which
  includes both annotated tags and lightweight ones.

use_max_tag
  Set this to ``true`` to check for the max tag on GitHub. Unlike ``use_latest_release``,
  this option includes both annotated tags and lightweight ones, and return the biggest one
  sorted by ``pkg_resources.parse_version``.

ignored_tags
  Ignore certain tags while computing the max tag. Tags are separate by
  whitespaces. This option must be used together with ``use_max_tag``. This can
  be useful to avoid some known badly versioned tags, so the newer tags won't
  be "overridden" by the old broken ones.

sort_version_key
  Sort the version string using this key function. Choose between ``parse_version`` and 
  ``vercmp``. Default value is ``parse_version``. ``parse_version`` use 
  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. ``vercmp`` use ``pyalpm.vercmp``.

proxy
  The HTTP proxy to use. The format is ``host:port``, e.g. ``localhost:8087``. This requires `pycurl <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_.

An environment variable ``NVCHECKER_GITHUB_TOKEN`` can be set to a GitHub OAuth token in order to request more frequently than anonymously.

Check BitBucket
---------------
Check `BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ for updates. The version returned is in date format ``%Y%m%d``, e.g. ``20130701``.

bitbucket
  The bitbucket repository, with author, e.g. ``lilydjwg/dotvim``.

branch
  Which branch to track? Default is the repository's default.

use_max_tag
  Set this to ``true`` to check for the max tag on BitBucket. Will return the biggest one
  sorted by ``pkg_resources.parse_version``.

ignored_tags
  Ignore certain tags while computing the max tag. Tags are separate by
  whitespaces. This option must be used together with ``use_max_tag``. This can
  be useful to avoid some known badly versioned tags, so the newer tags won't
  be "overridden" by the old broken ones.

sort_version_key
  Sort the version string using this key function. Choose between ``parse_version`` and 
  ``vercmp``. Default value is ``parse_version``. ``parse_version`` use 
  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. ``vercmp`` use ``pyalpm.vercmp``.

Check GitLab
-------------
Check `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/>`_ for updates. The version returned is in date format ``%Y%m%d``, e.g. ``20130701``.

gitlab
  The gitlab repository, with author, e.g. ``Deepin/deepin-music``.

branch
  Which branch to track? Default: ``master``.

use_max_tag
  Set this to ``true`` to check for the max tag on BitBucket. Will return the biggest one
  sorted by ``pkg_resources.parse_version``.

ignored_tags
  Ignore certain tags while computing the max tag. Tags are separate by
  whitespaces. This option must be used together with ``use_max_tag``. This can
  be useful to avoid some known badly versioned tags, so the newer tags won't
  be "overridden" by the old broken ones.

sort_version_key
  Sort the version string using this key function. Choose between ``parse_version`` and 
  ``vercmp``. Default value is ``parse_version``. ``parse_version`` use 
  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. ``vercmp`` use ``pyalpm.vercmp``.

host
  Hostname for self-hosted GitLab instance.

token
  GitLab authorization token used to call the API. If not specified, an environment variable ``NVCHECKER_GITLAB_TOKEN_host`` must provide that token. The ``host`` part is the uppercased version of the ``host`` setting, with dots (``.``) and slashes (``/``) replaced by underscores (``_``), e.g. ``NVCHECKER_GITLAB_TOKEN_GITLAB_COM``.

Authenticated only.

Check PyPI
----------
Check `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/>`_ for updates.

This is used when you run ``nvchecker`` on an Arch Linux system and the program always keeps up with a package in your configured repositories for `Pacman`_.

pacman
  The package name to reference to.

strip-release
  Strip the release part.

Check Arch Linux official packages
----------------------------------
This enables you to track the update of `Arch Linux official packages <https://www.archlinux.org/packages/>`_, without needing of pacman and an updated local Pacman databases.

archpkg
  Name of the Arch Linux package.

strip-release
  Strip the release part.

Check Google Code (hg repository)
---------------------------------
Check a mercurial (hg) repository on `Google Code <https://code.google.com/>`_ for updates. The version returned is in date format ``%Y%m%d``, e.g. ``20130701``.

Manually updating
-----------------
This enables you to manually specify the version (maybe because you want to approve each release before it gets to the script).

manual
  The version string.

Version Control System (VCS) (git, hg, svn, bzr)
------------------------------------------------
Check a VCS repo for new commits. The version returned is currently not related to the version of the software and will increase whenever the referred VCS branch changes. This is mainly for Arch Linux.

vcs
  The url of the remote VCS repo, using the same syntax with a VCS url in PKGBUILD (`Pacman`_'s build script). The first VCS url found in the source array of the PKGBUILD will be used if this is left blank. (Note: for a blank ``vcs`` setting to work correctly, the PKGBUILD has to be in a directory with the name of the software under the path where nvchecker is run. Also, all the commands, if any, needed when sourcing the PKGBUILD need to be installed).

use_max_tag
  Set this to ``true`` to check for the max tag. Currently only supported for ``git``.
  This option returns the biggest tag sorted by ``pkg_resources.parse_version``.

ignored_tags
  Ignore certain tags while computing the max tag. Tags are separate by
  whitespaces. This option must be used together with ``use_max_tag``. This can
  be useful to avoid some known badly versioned tags, so the newer tags won't
  be "overridden" by the old broken ones.
